# Approach

## General Approach

The Project was structured in Blocks, according to the Block Diagram. 
Each Block was programmed individually and tested on hardware. 
For the ReadTach Module a extra Simulation-file was used as described later.
The idea for the HardwareCircuits is from Alex over at [AEQ-Web] [1]

- What was your approach to the problem and what is your solution?
- You should also include approaches that did not work.
