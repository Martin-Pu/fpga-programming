## Voltage Divider 

A Voltage Divider is a simple is a simple circuit to achieve a certain voltage, when only a higher voltage is available.

It uses the simple principle of a voltage drop across a resistor.

![Voltage Divider](Images/VoltageDivider.PNG "Voltage Divider").

As shown in the figure above, its just two resistors in series, and the output is taken from the bottom two wires that exit to the right (the upper one is the reduced Voltage, the lower one Ground).

The formula is given as follows: Vout = R2/(R1 \+ R2) \* Vin  where R1 is the upper Resistor and R2 the lower one.


## ADC

ADC stands for Analog to Digital Converter. These kind of ICs are used where the analog world meats a Digital Processor or in this case FPGA.

ADCs convert an Analog Voltage into a digital Signal which is then processable by the FPGA. 

The ADC communicates with the FPGA (or Micro Controller) via a communication protocol like SPI or I2C

In this work a MCP3201 is used, which is a single channel 12bit ADC that communicates over SPI. The SPI Bus is explained in the following segment.


## SPI

SPI is a common communication bus to communicate with peripherals like sensors. It has 5 major connections: 
- Vin 
- Ground
- MOSI (SDO from Master perspective) \- Master Out Slave In
- MISO (SDI from Master perspective) \- Master In Slave Out
- CS (CS as an inverted enable signal for the Device) \- Chip Select 

MOSI and MISO are shared data lines, whereas every sensor gets its on CS line.

The master in this case the FPGA controls the communication, and chooses with which bus user it wants to communicate with, by pulling its CS Pin Low 


## Operational Amplifier

An operational Amplifier does what its name implies - it amplifies. Different surrounding circuits make it a very flexible circuit. 

In this project it is simply used to amplify the voltage difference that occurs when the Resistance of the Temperature Element changes and thus the voltage of the voltage divider changes. 


## Open Collector IO / Tach Signal of Fan

The Open Collector Input Output Pins, are often used in Micro Controllers or ICs. 

When active the device simply turns on an internal Mosfet, and connects the Pin to ground.

Open Collectors are often used in combination with an external or internal Pull-Up Resistor. To whichever Voltage level the Resistor is connected is the maximum input Voltage for the external device.

In this project, the fans have Open Collector Pins on the Tach signal. The Voltage is then pulled up to 3.3V in Hardware.

This way the Fan outputs a 3.3V to Ground PWM Signal which is readable by the FPGA.

The PWM signal frequency also has to be divided in half, because the magnetic sensor in the Fan gets activated twice per Rotation of the fan.


## PT1000

A PT1000 is a resistive temperature element (RTD). It changes its resistance roughly linearly with temperature what makes the conversion simple. 

The changing resistance can be converted into a voltage via a voltage divider. 

The 1000 in PT1000 stands for 1000 Ohm Resistance at 0Â°C.


## Clock Divider

Clock dividers do what their names imply and turn a higher frequency clock into a lower one. 

Clock dividers are most often implemented in software. Their simplest implementation is to use a counter and taking the output from the third digit (1:8 Clock divider). Most often an intentional overflow is used to "reset" the counter.
Alternatively, for a more precise clock the counter can be checked if it has achieved a certain value, and if so reseting the counter. The second approach is used in 


## Seven Segment Display

A Seven Segment Display is a Display with only 7 (or 8 with decimal point) inputs. It is used most often used to Display (hexadecimal) numbers or error codes, by illuminating different segments.

For a more in depth information on Seven Segment Displays on the boolean board check out the [boolean Board Reference Manual](https://www.realdigital.org/doc/02013cd17602c8af749f00561f88ae21)

## PMod 

The PMod interface is a way to connect external peripherals to the boolean board. For this work PModA of the boolean board was used.

For more information check out the [boolean Board Reference Manual](https://www.realdigital.org/doc/02013cd17602c8af749f00561f88ae21)

From the reference manual I used the pinout to connect the Connectors in my Constraint File.
