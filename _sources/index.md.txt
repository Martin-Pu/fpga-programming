# FPGA Fan Control

In this Documentation a Temperature based Fan Controller for a FPGA is developed on the boolean board from [realdigtial](https://www.realdigital.org/).

The requirements from the digital course were uploaded to a [repository](https://mygit.th-deg.de/mp03422/fpga-programming-projects)

The files for the final project are in a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Martin-Pu/FpgaFanCtrl)

The final results are displayed in a ~3min [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/ZYJzqI10RaQ)
